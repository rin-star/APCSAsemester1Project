# Pokémon Virtual Pet Simulation Project

This program models interactive Pokémon companions using Java classes. The project demonstrates core object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, composition, constructors, method overloading, and dynamic behaviors.

The Pokémon Virtual Pet Simulation allows users to adopt Pokémon, feed them, train them, evolve them, and monitor their happiness, energy, and unique type-based responses. Each Pokémon species behaves differently depending on its typing, environment, and user interactions.

## Project Structure

* `src`: contains the Java source files (`shinx.java`, `cleffa.java`, `riolu.java`, `litwick.java`, `main.java`)
* `lib`: contains any dependencies if added
* `bin`: the folder where compiled `.class` files are generated by default

If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

  Please check this flowchart for more detailed information.

### main.java

Represents the main class for the Pokémon simulation. This class serves as the entry point for the program and manages the overall flow of the simulation.

Includes:
- User interface for adopting, feeding, training, and evolving Pokémon.
- Tracks and updates Pokémon stats (happiness, energy, etc.).
- Handles user input and displays menus.

---

### shinx.java

Represents the Electric-type Pokémon, Shinx. This class models Shinx's unique behaviors and stats.

Includes:
- Methods for feeding, training, and evolving Shinx.
- Tracks happiness and energy levels.
- Implements type-specific responses to user actions.

---

### cleffa.java

Represents the Fairy-type Pokémon, Cleffa. This class models Cleffa's unique behaviors and stats.

Includes:
- Methods for feeding, training, and evolving Cleffa.
- Tracks happiness and energy levels.
- Implements type-specific responses to user actions.

---

### riolu.java

Represents the Fighting-type Pokémon, Riolu. This class models Riolu's unique behaviors and stats.

Includes:
- Methods for feeding, training, and evolving Riolu.
- Tracks happiness and energy levels.
- Implements type-specific responses to user actions.

---

### litwick.java

Represents the Ghost/Fire-type Pokémon, Litwick. This class models Litwick's unique behaviors and stats.

Includes:
- Methods for feeding, training, and evolving Litwick.
- Tracks happiness and energy levels.
- Implements type-specific responses to user actions.

## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```
3. Run the tester class:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin BirdTester
   ```

## Example Output

```

```

## Learning Objectives

* Write and call constructors, including overloaded constructors.
* Write methods with parameters and return values.
* Write and use custom classes in Java.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view in Visual Studio Code allows you to manage dependencies. More details can be found in the [VS Code Java Dependency Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
