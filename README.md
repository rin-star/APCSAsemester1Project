Welcome to the Pokémon Virtual Pet Simulation Project

This program models interactive Pokémon companions using Java classes. The project demonstrates core object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, composition, constructors, method overloading, and dynamic behaviors.

The Pokémon Virtual Pet Simulation allows users to adopt Pokémon, feed them, train them, evolve them, and monitor their happiness, energy, and unique type-based responses. Each Pokémon species behaves differently depending on its typing, environment, and user interactions. The project highlights key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts while giving users a fun and engaging digital Pokémon care experience.

The workspace contains the following folders:

* `src`: contains the Java source files (`shinx.java`, `cleffa.java`, `riolu.java`, `litwick.java`, `main.java`)
* `lib`: contains any dependencies if added
* `bin`: the folder where compiled `.class` files are generated by default

If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

### main.java

Represents the main class for the bird object.
Includes:

* 

### shinx.java



### cleffa.java

### riolu.java

### litwick.java




## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```
3. Run the tester class:

   ```bash
   java -cp bin BirdTester
   ```

## Example Output

```

```

## Learning Objectives

* Write and call constructors, including overloaded constructors.
* Write methods with parameters and return values.
* Write and use custom classes in Java.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view in Visual Studio Code allows you to manage dependencies. More details can be found in the [VS Code Java Dependency Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
